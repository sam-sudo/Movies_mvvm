## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a movie viewer application using Kotlin and following the MVVM architecture. Users should be able to view a list of movies, access detailed information for each movie, and perform various actions.

## Requirements

- [ ] **Architecture**: Implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to structure the application.
- [ ] **Loading Animation**: Include a loading animation in both the Home and Detail Screens. This could be a spinner or linear loading indicator.
- [ ] **Favorites**: Provide a button to add movies to favorites. Display an indicator icon in the list and on the favorites screen.
- [ ] **Pull to Refresh**: Implement the pull-to-refresh feature to refresh the list of movies.
- [ ] **Testing**: Include at least one unit test to ensure the reliability of the application.

## Additional Considerations

The following aspects are positively valued in the project:

- [ ] **Coroutines**: Use coroutines for asynchronous programming.
- [ ] **Data Persistence**: Implement some method of data persistence, such as Room or SharedPreferences.
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Consider using dependency injection libraries to manage dependencies.
- [ ] **Retrofit**: Utilize Retrofit or a similar library for handling network requests.
- [ ] **Collapsing Toolbar**: Implement a collapsing toolbar on the detail screen for the movie image.
- [ ] **Search Bar**: Include a search bar in the home screen for easy navigation.
